## ⭐️ Features

-   Custom cursor on hover of a target element
-   Small in size
-   Written purely in Typescript
-   Basic and really simple to use
-   Works everywhere, anytime
-   Options for custom functionality
-   Functionality only, no styling limitations

## 📦 Getting Started

### NPM

```
npm i hover-cursor
```

### Yarn

```
yarn add hover-cursor
```

In your project, import the HoverCursor class like so:

```js
import { HoverCursor } from 'hover-cursor'
```

Usage:

> **Note**: If the element does not load, make sure you are initialising your HoverCursor after `DOMContentLoaded`!

```js
new HoverCursor({
    containerQuery: '.floating-video',
    snapPosition: 'R'
})
```

## 🙋‍♂️ Example

The following code produces the behaviour displayed in the GIF. Icon does get toggled but just changed the classes in this demo. By putting in a FontAwesome class such as `fa-solid fa-volume-high` it will show the icon and toggle it.

![](https://github.com/rps-code/hover-cursor/blob/main/demo.gif)

```js
import { HoverCursor } from 'hover-cursor'

document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
    function toggleCursor() {
        console.log('Function called when element is clicked')
    }

    new HoverCursor({
        containerQuery: '.floating-video',
        snapPosition: 'R',
        customClass: 'my-custom-class',
        title: 'Sound On',
        toggledTitle: 'Sound Off',
        icon: 'ICON 1',
        toggledIcon: 'ICON 2',
        toggledFunction: toggleCursor
    })
})
```

```css
div.hover-cursor {
    position: absolute;
    width: 7rem;
    height: 7rem;
    border-radius: 50%;
    background: black;
    pointer-events: none;
    z-index: 10;
    top: 50%;
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
    flex-direction: column;
    left: 50%;
    transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
}
```
